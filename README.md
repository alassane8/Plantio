In this repsitory, you have access to the battlshimy first mobile application that I developped using, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Next.js.

## Part 1. Initialize the Next.js application (easy level)

> Install [`npx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) if it is not yet installed.

Initialize a Next.js application by following [this guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) to start. Under your repository root, run the `npx create-next-app@latest` and name your application as `app`. It must create the `app` folder.

```bash
npm init -y
npm install -g npx
npx create-next-app@latest
```

typescript no
eslint yes
tailwindcss yes
src/'directory no
App Router yes
import alias no


## Part 2. Build a website skeleton

1. Learn [React components](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html), [Next.js pages](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages) and [Next.js routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction) to continue with the next steps.


## Part 3. Build dynamic routes (medium level)

1. Learn [dynamic routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes) in Next.js.
